## zmqc

zmqc is a small but powerful command-line interface to [Ã˜MQ][zmq]. It allows
you to create a socket of a given type, bind or connect it to multiple
addresses, set options on it, and receive or send messages over it using
standard I/O, in the shell or in scripts. It's useful for debugging and
experimenting with most possible network topologies.

### Usage

    zmqc [-h] [-v] [-0] (-r | -w) (-b | -c) SOCK_TYPE [-o SOCK_OPT=VALUE...] address [address ...]

#### Mode

<dl>
  <dt>-r, --read</dt>
    <dd>Read messages from the socket onto stdout.</dd>

  <dt>-w, --write</dt>
    <dd>Write messages from stdin to the socket.</dd>
</dl>

#### Behavior

<dl>
  <dt>-b, --bind</dt>
    <dd>Bind to the specified address(es).</dd>
  <dt>-c, --connect</dt>
    <dd>Connect to the specified address(es).</dd>
</dl>

#### Socket Parameters

<dl>
  <dt>SOCK_TYPE</dt>
  <dd>
    Which type of socket to create. Must be one of `PUSH`, `PULL`, `PUB`, `SUB`
    or `PAIR`. See `man zmq_socket` for an explanation of the different types.
    `REQ`, `REP`, `DEALER` and `ROUTER` sockets are currently unsupported.
    **--read** mode is unsupported for PUB sockets, and **--write** mode is
    unsupported for `SUB` sockets.
  </dd>
  <dt>-o SOCK_OPT=VALUE, --option SOCK_OPT=VALUE</dt>
  <dd>
    Socket option names and values to set on the created socket. Consult `man
    zmq_setsockopt` for a comprehensive list of options. Note that you can
    safely omit the `ZMQ_` prefix from the option name. If the created socket
    is of type `SUB`, and no `SUBSCRIBE` options are given, the socket will
    automatically be subscribed to everything.
  </dd>
  <dt>address</dt>
  <dd>
    One or more addresses to bind/connect to. Must be in full ZMQ format (e.g.
    `tcp://<host>:<port>`)
  </dd>
</dt>


## Examples

    zmqc -rc SUB 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5000'

Subscribe to `tcp://127.0.0.1:5000`, reading messages from it and printing them
to the console. This will subscribe to all messages by default.

* * * *

    ls | zmqc -wb PUSH 'tcp://*:4000'

Send the name of every file in the current directory as a message from a PUSH
socket bound to port 4000 on all interfaces. Don't forget to quote the address
to avoid glob expansion.

* * * *

    zmqc -rc PULL 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5202' | tee $TTY | zmqc -wc PUSH 'tcp://127.0.0.1:5404'

Read messages coming from a PUSH socket bound to port 5202 (note that we're
connecting with a PULL socket), echo them to the active console, and forward
them to a PULL socket bound to port 5404 (so we're connecting with a PUSH).

* * * *

    zmqc -n 10 -0rb PULL 'tcp://*:4123' | xargs -0 grep 'pattern'

Bind to a PULL socket on port 4123, receive 10 messages from the socket
(with each message representing a filename), and grep the files for
`'pattern'`. The `-0` option means messages will be NULL-delimited rather
than separated by newlines, so that filenames with spaces in them are not
considered two separate arguments by xargs.
